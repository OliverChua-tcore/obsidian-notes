# Name suffixes

## Types of name suffixes

### Generational suffixes
- `Jr.` (Junior): Used by a son who shares the same first, middle, and last name as his father
	- The father uses `Sr.` (Senior)
- `II`, `III`, `IV`, etc.: Used when a man is named after a grandfather, uncle, or cousin
- When spelled out, these are lowercase (e.g., "junior", "the second", "the third")
- No comma is used before numerals (e.g., Robert Conner III)
- A comma is used before `Jr.` and `Sr.` (e.g., Dale Earnhardt, Jr.)
- If words follow the suffix, a comma is added (e.g., Sammy Davis, Jr., was a member of the Rat Pack)

### Academic and professional suffixes
#### Degrees
- Bachelor’s degrees (e.g., `BA`, `BS`, `LLB`)
- Master’s degrees (e.g., `MA`, `MBA`, `MSc`)
- Doctorate degrees (e.g., `PhD`, `MD`, `JD`, `EdD`)

#### Professional titles
- `Esq.`: Used for licensed attorneys in the U.S.
- `CPA`: Certified Public Accountant
- `CFA`: Chartered Financial Analyst
- `PE`: Professional Engineer
- `RN`: Registered Nurse
- `PMP`: Project Management Professional
- `CISA`, `CISSP`, `CISM`: Information security certifications
- `MS`: Master Sommelier
- `RA`, `AIA`, `RIBA`: Registered Architects

### Honorary and post-nominal suffixes
  - `OBE`, `KBE`, `CBE`: Honors from the British monarchy (e.g., Order of the British Empire)
  - `FRCPath`, `FRCS`, `MBE`: Professional or medical honors
  - `QC`: Queen’s Counsel (UK)
  - `OFM`, `CSV`: Religious institute initials (e.g., Franciscan, Clerics of Saint Viator)

## Key rules

- Suffixes appear _after the surname_
- Academic doctorates typically use _either_ a prefix (`Dr.`) _or_ a suffix (`PhD`), not both
- In the U.S., the suffix format is preferred for clarity (e.g., distinguishing `MD` vs. `PhD`)
- Social suffixes (`Jr.`, `Sr.`, `II`) are most commonly used for _men_, though exceptions exist
- Suffixes like `Jr.` may be dropped after a father’s death to avoid confusion
